        <h1>Educator</h1>
        <p class="editable explanation">Currently, I am a Graduate Fellow at University of North Texas teaching jazz bass students and pursuing a Doctor of Musical Arts in Jazz Studies.<br /><br />My musical background is composed of a bachelor's and master's degree from Eastern Washington University where I also was employed as a graduate teaching assistant. During this time I performed regularly throughout the region as a jazz bassist with guests including Bill Watrous, Jeff Clayton, Sid Jacobs, and Hal Galper. After moving to Athens, Ohio, I continued my professional performance endeavors with groups including the Huntington Symphony Orchestra, West Virginia Symphony Orchestra, Maniacal 4 Trombone Quartet and Vaughn Wiester's Famous Jazz Orchestra as well as individual artists and pedagogues like Louis Bonilla, Paul Johnson, Tom Walsh, Jeff Bair, Matthew James, Sean Parsons, James Moore, and Rob Parton. My professional experience also includes performing on riverboats, cruise ships, and being the touring bassist for Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. As an educator, I have experience as a private teacher, clinician, and adjunct instructor.</p>
