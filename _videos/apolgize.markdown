This piece was written by Toshihiko Sahashi, a Japanese composer best known for contributions to various Japanese anime shows. His work has also been used in the well-known American comedy-drama Scrubs. His style shows use of both classical and jazz techniques which speak to his extensive study of western musical styles.
