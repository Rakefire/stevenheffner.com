Olivia Brownlee is one of the most musical souls I’ve encountered and I count myself lucky to have known her since 2001. It didn’t take long for us to find each other intersecting at various musical outlets in Washington State and it was only fitting that over a decade later we would have a last minute rendezvous at a recording studio and put together a song that expressed a little bit of her home in Boston, MA. http://oliviabrownlee.com/2015/05/21/headin-right-in-to-brighton/https://soundcloud.com/olivia-brownlee/8-headin-right-in-to-brighton
